Bitfighter uses NSIS (Nullsoft Scriptable Install System) to manage the install/uninstall process on Windows systems.  Download it here:

http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Main_Page

You can create an install by "compiling" Bitfighter_installer.nsi.

Note that the installer will include all levels in the clean-levels folder, but none from elsewhere (such as the exe folder)

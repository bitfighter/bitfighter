need libmysqlclient-dev
need mysql++
	wget http://tangentsoft.net/mysql++/releases/mysql++-3.1.0.tar.gz
	./configure
	make
	(Note, to get it to compile, I needed to add #include <string.h> to the file that complained.  This seems to be a known bug)

After compiling, move the whole mysql++ folder to be parallel with master, and
rename it mysql++

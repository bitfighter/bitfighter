@page datatypes Datatypes in Bitfighter

@section xpoint Point

Points represent an xy coordinate pair or a vector with an x and y component.  They are constructed as
tables in Lua, but can be used like classes.  See the \ref point class for
further details.

Note that unlike other Bitfighter classes, points are not capitalized for historical reasons.

@section geometry Geometry

Geometry is not a formal datatype, but rather a reference to
either to a point or a table of points, depending on the context.
For example, if the object is inherently point-like (such as an Item or
Projectile), then geometry is a point.  For more complex objects (such as a
WallItem or a Zone), geometry refers to a Lua table of points.

Some objects
have a specific number of points.  A TextItem, for example, consists of exactly
two points, defining its start and endpoints.  Some items (like \link Zone Zones \endlink and \link
PolyWall PolyWalls \endlink) must have a minimum of three points.  See the
documentation for individual items for details.

The Geom class provides a collection of tools to make common transformations to
a point or a table of points.


@section other Other Datatypes

*bool* - Either `true` or `false`.  In Lua, both nil and false make a condition
false; any other value makes it true.

*int* - A number that has no decimal component.  Unlike some languages, Lua does
not distinguish between integers and floating point numbers -- they are both
stored internally as numbers.  When a function requires an integer argument,
and you provide a floating point number, the fraction will be silently dropped.

*num* - A integer or real (double-precision floating-point) number.

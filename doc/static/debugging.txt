@page debugging Debugging Tips

Any of your scripts can print a stack trace with the `_stackTracer()` command (see sample usage below).  This will show how you got to a particular execution point, and will print the values of various variables and other potentially useful information.  This can be very helpful if there are several conditions under which a function can be called, or why something went wrong.

The `print(msg)` command will print a message the in-game console (which you can turn on with [Ctrl+/]) as well as the logfile (`bitfighter.log`), and `logprint(msg)` will print a message to the console, the logfile, and the terminal.  Both commands can accept multiple arguments (see sample below).

For most cases, `print` and `logprint` are interchangable.  Note that it is possible to disable script logging to the logfile in your configuration.  If you don't see the messages you expect, check the [Diagnostics] section of the `bitfighter.ini` file, and make sure the `LuaScriptMessage` setting is `Yes`.

`print` and `logprint` both go to the in-game console; `logprint` goes to the terminal window but `print` does not; by default both get logged to `bitfighter.log`, but this can be controlled in the INI file.

Lua's <code>[error](http://www.lua.org/manual/5.2/manual.html#pdf-error)</code> command will stop the script, print a message, and cause a stack trace to be printed.  Use <code>[assert](https://web.archive.org/web/20191231230706/http://luatut.com/assert.html)</code> to confirm that a condition is true.

Finally, if you detect an unexpected error condition, you can log a message, trigger a stack trace, and terminate the script with Lua's `error` function.

\code
logprint("target:", target, "hits:", hitcount)  -- Accepts multiple arguments
print("Stack trace:")
print(_stackTracer())

if target == nil then
    error("Have a nil target!")                 -- Terminates script and prints stack trace
end
assert(target2, "target2 should not be nil!")   -- Use Lua's assert function to verify conditions that should be true
\endcode

Other tricks:

There are a couple of other ways to get info out of a script.  None of these are appropriate for long term usage, but they do work well for quick and dirty debugging.

Bots can print short messages to the global chat like so:

\code
bot:globalMsg("Status " .. status)
bot:privateMsg(message, "ChumpChange")          -- If you know your player name!
\endcode

Levelgens can do this as well, or print short messages by setting the announcement message:
\code
levelgen:globalMsg("success!")
levelgen:announce("I'm at: " .. p.x .. "," .. p.y)

levelgen:privateMsg(message, "ChumpChange")     -- If you know your player name!
\endcode

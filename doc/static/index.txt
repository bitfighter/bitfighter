@section intro_sec Introduction

Here is some info about scripting levels and robots in Bitfighter.

All scripts must contain a \e main() function.  There are some subtle
differences between how bots and levelgens use this function, but we can
ignore those for the moment.  The important thing is the \e main()
function is run when the script is loaded, and should contain any
configuration code the script requires.  

It is possible to specify a list of arguments to be passed to a robot or
levelgen script.  These arguments will be placed in a table called \e
arg, which is the standard Lua location for storing command line
parameters.
